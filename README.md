Voice Encounter Mods
=================

Voice Encounter Mods is based on the well known WOW addon DBM(Deadly Boss Mods), which means we have all the functions from the official DBM. 

However, in this addon, we also try our best to give you more helpful functions than the official DBM.

Please notice that this project here is just a copy which implements English language pack.

If you speak Chinese, you can find the original version at http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=5397726&page=1

All English voice is generated via VoiceRss.org TTS(Text-to-Speech) api.

If you feel uncomfortable with the robot accent and want to contribute as our voice actress/actor. Please contact me. Thanks.

How To Use
=================

[Download Zip] (https://github.com/henryj/Voice-Encounter-Mods/archive/master.zip)

Unzip into your WoW addons folder.

(You may want to remove your official DBM first.)

Have fun.

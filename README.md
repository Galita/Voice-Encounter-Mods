DBM-VoiceEnhanced
=================

This is an unfinished English copy.

If you speak Chinese, please find the full original version at http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=5397726&page=1

At this moment only the text for TOT is translated. 

Though voice part is still undergoing I personally still believe it's a much better version than the original DBM.


How To Use
=================

Download full version of DBM and install. (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods)

Goto the addon folder.

Remove DBM-Core, DBM-GUI, DBM-ThroneofThunder and replace them with what you downloaded here.

Have fun.

Voice Encounter Mods
=================

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>This addon is forked from the well known <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/deadly-boss-mods">DBM</a> but with a different planned direction of development. It has most the functions from the original DBM plus continued <a href="http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/hudmap">HudMap</a> and various voice warnings.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will have literally voice warnings for all the critical boss abilities. </li>
<li>You will have Hud Maps for float stack points on the player.</li>
<li>You will have arrows on your screen pointing out the direction you should go.</li>
</ul>

<p>Install this Voice Encounter Mods and progress easily than ever before.</p>

<h3>Custom Voice Pack</h3>
<p>With the latest version, we support user custom voice packs. If you're interested in making your own voice pack and to be listed here please contact us.</p>

<h6>How to use:</h6>
<ol>
<li>Go to your addons folder and find "VEM-Core\extrasounds\other" folder;</li>
<li>Download one of the custom voice packs below or record your own voice pack and put the mp3 files under that folder you found in step 1;</li>
<li>If you're making your own voice pack you may customize the other.lua which is the intro of your pack and the other.tga which should be your favorite avatar;</li>
<li>You may find the default voice text and filename mapping <a href="https://github.com/henryj/Voice-Encounter-Mods/blob/master/VoiceText.txt">here</a> (just for your reference, you may change them to make it better or fun or whatever. lol. );</li>
</ol>

<h6>List of custom voice packs:</h6>
<p>Simply download one of them and replace the "VEM-Core\extrasounds\other" folder. After that launch the game, and you'll be able to switch to your new voice pack by /vem -> Options -> Raid Warnings -> Set Voice </p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/henryj/VEM-Sounds-Voicerss/archive/master.zip">Default EN voice pack used before 5.4 by VoiceRss.org TTS service</a> (5.4.4 compatible. In case some people are more used to the old version)</li>
</ul>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to install DBM or Hudmap or any other addons to make VEM work?</b></p>
<p>A: Nope. VEM has everything built-in. We also don't recommend that you use VEM with other encounter mods unless you know exactly what you are doing/needing.</p>

<p><b>Q: Is there a way to turn up the voice?</b></p>
<p>A: Go to System -> Sound -> Volume, while keep the master volume up, turn down all the 3 sub ones (sound, music, ambience). If that doesn't work for you and you are running windows, please check your windows sound settings and turn OFF loudness equalization.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does this compatible with old modules of DBM like WotLK?</b></p>
<p>A: Sorry, you'll need the old DBM core for that. <del>There're VEM like addons with old content compatible in some way but only in Chinese I believe and legally I shouldn't talk about that here coz old DBM is not under opensource license. :))</del></p>
